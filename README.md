# My portfolio

## Description 
So for this project I have created a portfolio using react. With the about me, contact info and projects

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance criteria
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
