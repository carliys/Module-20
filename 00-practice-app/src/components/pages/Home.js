      I'm excited to share some of my upcoming coding
      projects, which will soon be available to view
      in my portfolio. One project I'm currently
      working on is a NoSQL development tool.
      I used MySQL and other tools to design
      and implement this project, and overcame 
      several challenges.

      Another project I'm working on is weather service app, which uses a certain API to 
      forecast the weather in real time. The development process for this project
      involved alot of sleep less nights and help from my colleagues. I'm 
      looking forward to adding new features and 
      functionality to this project in the future,
      such as emojis that indicate the weather.

      Stay tuned for more information on these projects and others,
      as I continue to refine my coding skills and explore new areas
      of development. I'm passionate about creating innovative and
      user-friendly applications, and I'm excited to share my work 
      with potential clients and employers.
